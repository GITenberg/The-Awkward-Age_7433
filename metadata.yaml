description: "The Awkward Age is a novel by Henry James, first published as a serial\
  \ in Harper's Weekly in 1898-1899 and then as a book later in 1899. Originally conceived\
  \ as a brief, light story about the complications created in her family's social\
  \ set by a young girl coming of age, the novel expanded into a general treatment\
  \ of decadence and corruption in English fin de si√®cle life. James presents the\
  \ novel almost entirely in dialogue, an experiment that adds to the immediacy of\
  \ the scenes but also creates serious ambiguities about characters and their motives.\n\
